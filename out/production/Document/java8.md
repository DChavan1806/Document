- Java 8 introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language and the Java platform. Hereâ€™s a summary of the most notable features:

1. Lambda Expressions
   Description: Allows you to write concise and expressive code using function-like syntax.
   Example: list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
2. Functional Interfaces
   Description: An interface with a single abstract method, which can be represented as a lambda expression.
   Common Functional Interfaces:
   Runnable
   Callable
   Consumer<T>
   Supplier<T>
   Function<T, R>
   Predicate<T>
3. Streams API
   Description: Provides a way to process sequences of elements (collections) in a functional style, supporting operations such as filter, map, and reduce.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);
4. Default Methods in Interfaces
   Description: Allows interfaces to have method implementations (default methods), enabling the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   interface MyInterface {
   default void myDefaultMethod() {
   System.out.println("Default method implementation");
   }
   }
5. Method References
   Description: A shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. They provide a way to refer to methods without invoking them.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.forEach(System.out::println); // Method reference instead of lambda
6. Optional Class
   Description: A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value, used to avoid null references and NullPointerExceptions.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.ofNullable(name);
   optionalName.ifPresent(System.out::println);
7. New Date and Time API
   Description: Introduces a new set of classes for date and time manipulation, providing better handling and more features than the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
   LocalDate nextWeek = date.plusWeeks(1);
8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
   Description: A new lightweight JavaScript engine that allows for executing JavaScript code within Java applications, replacing the older Rhino engine.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
   engine.eval("print('Hello from JavaScript');");
9. CompletableFuture and Concurrency Enhancements
   Description: Introduces the CompletableFuture class for better asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking and functional-style completion handling.
   Example:
   java
   Copy code
   CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
   // some long-running task
   return "Result";
   }).thenAccept(result -> System.out.println(result));
10. Parallel Operations
    Description: The Streams API supports parallel processing with the parallelStream() method, enabling easy parallelism for performance improvements.
    Example:
    java
    Copy code
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
    names.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
    Summary
    Java 8 brought substantial improvements to the Java programming language, making it more functional and expressive. The introduction of lambda expressions, the Streams API, and the new Date and Time API are some of the most significant features that greatly enhance the way Java developers write and maintain code.
