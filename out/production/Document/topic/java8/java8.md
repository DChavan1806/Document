- Java 8 introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language and the Java platform. 
- Hereâ€™s a summary of the most notable features:
1. Lambda Expressions : 
   - Description: Allows you to write concise and expressive code using function-like syntax.
   - Advantages of Lambda Expressions
       1. **Concise and readable**: Reduce the boilerplate code associated with anonymous inner classes.
       2. **Enables functional programming**: Java becomes more functional and can handle operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing in a declarative way.
       3. **Better support for parallel operations**: Lambda expressions work well with the Streams API, which supports parallel processing easily.

         list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
   -  Limitations
      Complexity in debugging: Since lambdas are anonymous and don't have a name or location, debugging complex lambdas can sometimes be difficult.
      Performance: In some cases, lambdas might introduce performance overhead, especially if used in highly performance-sensitive applications, though in general, they are efficiently handled by the JVM.
   - Lambda expressions are most commonly used in:
     1. **Event handling**: Instead of anonymous classes in GUI programming.
     2. **Collection processing**: Simplified operations like filter, map, and reduce on collections.
     3. **Asynchronous programming**: Passing lambda expressions to callbacks or event listeners

2. Functional Interfaces
   Description: An interface with a single abstract method, which can be represented as a lambda expression.
   Common Functional Interfaces: java.util.function -> @functionalInterface -> single abstract api
   - q1. Can we use lambda expressions with any interface?
   - q2. Differance between runnable and callable

           Runnable           : void run() - not input - no output -> only handled unchecked exception -> not result -> used with tread and Excuter service
           Callable.          : V call() - throws the exception - > handle both checked and unchecked exception -> use Future<V> to retrive result -> used with excuter service only
           Consumer<T>        : Represents an operation that takes an argument and returns no result (T -> void) : Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;
           Supplier<T>.       : Represents a function that takes no input and returns a result (no input -> T) : Supplier<Double> randomValue = () -> Math.random();
           Function<T, R>     : Takes an input and produces an output (T -> R) : Function<String, Integer> strLength = str -> str.length();
           Predicate<T>       : Represents a function that accepts one argument and returns a boolean : Predicate<Integer> isEven = num -> num % 2 == 0;
           UnaryOperator<T>   : A function that takes one argument and returns a result of the same type (T -> T) : UnaryOperator<Integer> square = x -> x * x;
           BiFunction<T, U, R>: Takes two arguments and returns a result (T, U -> R) : BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;
           BinaryOperator<T>  : Takes two arguments of the same type and returns a result of the same type (T, T -> T) : BinaryOperator<Integer> multiply = (a, b) -> a * b;

3. Streams API: 
   [stream-api.md](stream-api.md)
   - Description: Provides a way to process sequences of elements (collections) in a functional style, supporting operations such as filter, map, and reduce.

       List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
       names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);

4. Default Methods in Interfaces
   - Description: Allows interfaces to have method implementations (default methods), enabling the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
   
       interface MyInterface {
       default void myDefaultMethod() {
       System.out.println("Default method implementation");
       }
       }
   - q. how default with same name in differ interface work when concrete class implement both interface
     [DefaultMethod.java](program/DefaultMethod.java)

5. Method References
   - Description: A shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. They provide a way to refer to methods without invoking them.
   
       List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
       names.forEach(System.out::println); // Method reference instead of lambda
   - q. what purpose methode reference in java8 : 

6. Optional Class
   Description: A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value, used to avoid null references and NullPointerExceptions.

       Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.ofNullable(name);
       optionalName.ifPresent(System.out::println);

7. New Date and Time API
   - Description: Introduces a new set of classes for date and time manipulation, 
   - Providing better handling and more features than the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.
   
           LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
           LocalDate nextWeek = date.plusWeeks(1);
   - [New-Date-and-Time-API.md](New-Date-and-Time-API.md)

8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
   Description: A new lightweight JavaScript engine that allows for executing JavaScript code within Java applications, replacing the older Rhino engine.
   
       ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
       engine.eval("print('Hello from JavaScript');");

9. CompletableFuture and Concurrency Enhancements
   - Description: Introduces the CompletableFuture class for better asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking and functional-style completion handling.
   
           CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
           // some long-running task
           return "Result";
           }).thenAccept(result -> System.out.println(result));

10. Parallel Operations
    - Description: The Streams API supports parallel processing with the parallelStream() method, enabling easy parallelism for performance improvements.
    - Parallel operations in Java refer to the ability to execute multiple tasks concurrently, leveraging multicore processors to improve performance. 
    - The Java 8 Streams API introduced built-in support for parallel processing, enabling parallel operations on collections, arrays, or other data sources. 
    - This feature is particularly useful when you need to process large amounts of data and improve the throughput of applications.
    
           System.out.println("\nParallel Stream:");
           numbers.parallelStream().forEach(num -> System.out.println(num + " - " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
            outbut: 
            1 - ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
            2 - ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
            3 - ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2
    - Key Concepts
      1. Sequential Stream: Processes elements one at a time, in a single thread.
         `stream()`
      2. Parallel Stream: Splits the stream into multiple parts, processes each part in a separate thread, and combines the results. It enables parallelism with minimal effort.
         `parallelStream()`
      3. Fork/Join Framework: Used internally by parallel streams for splitting and merging tasks. It is part of the java.util.concurrent package and allows for work-stealing algorithms to optimize thread usage.
    - When to use Parallel Streams:
      1. Large data sets: Parallel streams are efficient when working with large collections or arrays.
      2. Multi-core processors: They leverage multiple cores to improve performance.
      3. CPU-bound tasks: Best suited for CPU-intensive operations like mathematical computations, transformations, etc.
    - When to avoid Parallel Streams:
      1. Small data sets: The overhead of managing threads can outweigh the benefits for small collections.
      2. I/O-bound tasks: Parallel streams may not significantly improve I/O-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O).
      3. Shared mutable state: Parallel streams can lead to thread-safety issues if working with shared mutable data.
    - q1. How do you control the size of the ForkJoinPool used by parallel streams?
    - Answer: By default, parallel streams use the common ForkJoinPool, which is determined by the number of available processors (usually Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()). 
       
          You can set the size of the pool using the system property:
          System.setProperty("java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism", "8");
