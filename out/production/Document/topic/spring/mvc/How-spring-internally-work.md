- The use of profiles and conditional annotations helps manage different configurations 
and behaviors in an application depending on the environment or specific conditions. 
1.  Profiles in Spring Boot
    - Profiles allow you to define different beans and configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). 
    - Spring Boot provides a convenient way to activate these profiles, often using the spring.profiles.active property.
    - Internal Working of Profiles :
      1. Profile Annotations: You can use the @Profile annotation to mark a bean to be registered only when a specific profile is active.
         `@Bean
         @Profile("dev")
            public MyService myServiceDev() {
            return new MyServiceDev();
         }`
      2. Active Profiles: When the application starts, 
         Spring checks the active profiles against the profiles defined in the beans. Only beans with matching profiles are loaded into the application context.
      3. Configuration Files: You can also define different properties files (e.g., application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties) for different profiles. 
         Spring Boot automatically loads the properties for the active profile.

2. Conditional Annotations
   - Spring Boot offers several conditional annotations that allow beans to be registered based on certain conditions. 
   - Some of the commonly used annotations are:
     1. @ConditionalOnProperty: Loads a bean only if a specific property is set in the configuration.
        `@Bean
        @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
            public MyFeature myFeature() {
            return new MyFeature();
        }`
     2. @ConditionalOnClass: Loads a bean only if a specific class is present on the classpath.
     3. @ConditionalOnMissingBean: Loads a bean only if a specific bean is not already defined in the context.
     4. @ConditionalOnWebApplication: Loads a bean only if the application is a web application.

   - Internal Working of Conditional Annotations
     1. When the application context is being built, Spring evaluates the conditions defined by these annotations.
     2. If the condition is met, the bean is registered; if not, it is ignored.

3. META-INF/spring.factories
   - The META-INF/spring.factories file is part of Spring Bootâ€™s autoconfiguration mechanism. 
   - It allows for modular configuration and is used to register various autoconfiguration classes.
   - internal Working of spring.factories
     1. Auto-Configuration: The spring.factories file contains mappings of autoconfiguration classes to their respective configuration properties. 
        This allows Spring Boot to load these configurations automatically based on the classpath and the defined conditions.
        `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
        com.example.autoconfig.MyAutoConfiguration,\
        com.example.autoconfig.AnotherAutoConfiguration`
     2. Loading Process:
        - When Spring Boot starts, it scans for the META-INF/spring.factories files on the classpath.
        - It retrieves the EnableAutoConfiguration entries and attempts to load each specified configuration class.
        - Conditions specified in these classes (e.g., using @ConditionalOnClass, @ConditionalOnProperty) determine if the beans in the configuration should be loaded.
