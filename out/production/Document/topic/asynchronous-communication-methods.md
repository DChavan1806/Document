1. Message Queues (point to point) (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS): 
   - Services exchange messages via queues, where one service puts a message into the queue, and another service processes it at its own pace.
   - Example: Service A places an order request in the queue, and Service B processes it asynchronously without Service A waiting.
   - Pros: Decoupling between services, reliable messaging, fault tolerance.
   - Cons: Complexity in ensuring message order and handling failures.

2. Event Streams (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis): 
   - Services communicate via streams where one service publishes events (messages), and other services subscribe and react to them.
   - Example: Service A publishes an event when a user signs up, and Service B processes the event to send a welcome email.
   - Pros: Scalable, high throughput, supports real-time event processing.
   - Cons: Handling distributed transactions and message ordering can be complex.

3. Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) (kafka): 
   - A messaging pattern where one service publishes messages to a topic, and multiple other services can subscribe to that topic.
   - Example: Service A publishes a message to a "payment processed" topic, and multiple services (Service B, Service C) act on this event, such as sending receipts or updating inventory.
   - Pros: Loose coupling, multiple services can subscribe to the same events.
   - Cons: Harder to track or troubleshoot because of decoupled services.

4. WebSockets: 
   - Real-time communication between microservices, often used for live data streaming or sending updates from one service to another.
   - Example: Service A sends real-time updates to Service B when a stock price changes.
   - Pros: Real-time bidirectional communication.
   - Cons: Not always suitable for large-scale, event-driven architectures.
