- Conflict between the two team members : 
1. Acknowledge the Conflict Calmly
"First, I would remain calm and not take sides. 
 It's important to understand that conflicts can arise even between highly experienced team members 
 due to differences in opinions, work styles, or approaches."

2. Understand the Root Cause
"I would meet with both individuals separately to get a complete understanding of the root cause. 
Active listening would play a crucial role here—I would let them express their perspectives without judgment."

3. Facilitate a Mediated Discussion
"Once I have gathered both sides, 
I would facilitate a meeting between the two in a neutral, constructive environment.
My role would be to ensure the discussion remains focused on resolving the issue rather than assigning blame."

4. Find Common Ground and Solutions
"I would guide the discussion toward identifying common goals—usually, 
both senior members have the same overall objective but differ in their approach. 
By identifying shared goals, I would help them work together to find a solution that benefits
 the project and team."

5. Establish Clear Communication
"Often, miscommunication is the underlying cause of conflicts. 
I would encourage open and clear communication going forward, 
setting up regular check-ins or touch points to ensure alignment."

6. Document and Follow Up
"Finally, I would document the agreed-upon resolution and follow up regularly to ensure both team members are staying on the same page.
 Monitoring the situation post-resolution would help prevent any future conflicts from arising."

7. Maintain Team Morale and Productivity
"Throughout the process, I would ensure the rest of the team remains focused and unaffected by the conflict. 
It's critical to lead by example, showing the team that conflicts are normal but must be resolved professionally."
