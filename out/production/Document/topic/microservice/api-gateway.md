- An API Gateway is a crucial component in microservices architecture, acting as a reverse proxy that routes client requests to the appropriate microservice. 
- It sits between external clients and backend services, providing various functionalities like request routing, API composition, rate limiting, security, and load balancing.

- Key Features of an API Gateway:
    1. Routing: Routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path, request headers, or other criteria.
    2. Authentication and Authorization: Can validate authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) and manage authorization before forwarding the request to services.
    3. Rate Limiting and Throttling: Controls the number of requests made to ensure that services don't get overwhelmed by excessive traffic.
    4. Load Balancing: Distributes requests across different instances of microservices to ensure high availability.
    5. Caching: Reduces load on services by caching responses to frequent requests.
    6. API Composition: Aggregates responses from multiple services into a single response.
    7. Security: Can enforce security policies like SSL termination, input validation, and prevention of attacks such as SQL injection or DDoS.
