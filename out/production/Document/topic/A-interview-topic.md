Q. Internal working of @Transactional annotation in spring boot
Q. Spring bean scope
Q. Database Isolation levels
Q. How does Red Black Tree work
Q. REST API best practices
Q. Disadvantages of Stream API
Q. Questions based on Set and Map
Q. So many others but I don't remember..
Given a String array String[] str = ["This is spring boot @autowired", "I don't remember @correctly", "but it was like this only @qualifier annotation", "@autowired @qualifier"];
Q.1 - Find all the unique words that starts with '@'. 
I was asked to solve this using Java Streams. EPAM is extremely serious about streams :) .
Output = [@autowired,@qualifier,@correctly];
Q.2 - DSA Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

1. Coding Round:
Create a simple voting system for N candidates with unique IDs ranging from 0 to n-1. 
Each voter casts 3 votes, with the first vote having 3x weight, 
the second 2x, and the third 1x. For example, 
if a voter votes for candidates A, B, and C, the votes for A, B, and C are incremented by 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
2. Systems Design:
Design a screen broadcast system where ads/videos can be played, replayed, changed, or scheduled for future broadcasts across multiple screens. It's a small-scale system.
Microservice architecture patterns such as API Gateway, BFF, Circuit Breaker, Database per Service, Event-Driven, and Saga pattern.
Richardson Maturity Model (RMM) and REST API grading.
Differences between SOAP and REST.
Hiring Manager Round:
3. Started with a system design for a train ticket booking app. Focus was on high-level design, particularly Back-of-the-Envelope estimation and database design to efficiently find available trains and seats between a source and destination.
