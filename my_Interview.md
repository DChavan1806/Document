10. In Java, when you have a child class (subclass) and a parent class (superclass) that both define a method with the same name and signature (i.e., the same parameters), 
    the method that gets called depends on the actual object type at runtime, not the type of the reference variable. This is known as method overriding
    `Parent obj = new Child(); // Parent reference holding a Child object
    obj.display(); // Calls Child's display method`
    - **Dynamic Method Dispatch:** 
         - When you call obj.display(), Java uses dynamic method dispatch (also known as late binding) to determine which display() method to invoke.
         - Since obj is actually referencing an instance of Child, the display() method from the Child class is called, even though obj is declared as type Parent.
    - **Compile-Time vs. Runtime:** 
         - The compiler checks the reference type at compile time and allows the method call (because obj is of type Parent), 
         - but the actual method execution is determined at runtime based on the actual object type (Child).
