- Agile is a project management and product development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. 
- SCRUM is one of the most popular frameworks within Agile, designed to help teams deliver complex projects in an iterative and incremental fashion.

- Key Principles of Agile (SCRUM):
1. Iterative Development: Work is broken down into smaller, manageable units (called sprints), usually lasting 2-4 weeks, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation.

2. Cross-functional Teams: SCRUM teams are typically small (7-9 members) and consist of people with various skills who collaborate closely to achieve common goals.

- Roles in SCRUM:
1. Product Owner: Represents the customer and is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog (list of features and tasks).
2. SCRUM Master: Facilitates the SCRUM process, helps remove obstacles, and ensures the team adheres to SCRUM principles.
3. Development Team: A self-organizing group responsible for delivering the product increment by the end of each sprint.
4. Daily Standups: Short, daily meetings (often called standups) where team members discuss progress, obstacles, and plans for the day.
5. Sprints: Each sprint is a time-boxed period where a specific set of features or product improvements are targeted for delivery. At the end of the sprint, a working product increment is presented.
6. Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, the team holds a meeting to plan what work will be accomplished in the sprint. The product owner prioritizes the tasks, and the team determines what they can commit to delivering.
7. Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates what they’ve built. This is an opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback.
9. Retrospective: After each sprint, the team holds a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how they can improve in the next sprint.
10. Backlog: The product backlog is a prioritized list of tasks, user stories, or features that need to be developed. The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog that is selected for completion during a sprint.
11. Adaptability and Feedback: One of the key aspects of Agile (SCRUM) is the focus on adapting to changing requirements through frequent feedback from stakeholders.

- Benefits of Agile (SCRUM):
1. Faster Delivery: Incremental releases ensure that the team is delivering usable products regularly.
2. Customer Focus: Frequent feedback helps ensure that the product meets customer needs.
3. Transparency: Daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives ensure that everyone on the team is aware of progress and issues.
4. Flexibility: Agile is designed to accommodate changing requirements and feedback during the development process.
5. This methodology is particularly effective in environments where requirements evolve and customer feedback is essential to shaping the product development process.


1. What is the key difference between Agile and Waterfall?

- Agile is iterative and incremental, where development is done in small parts (sprints) with continuous customer feedback, allowing changes during the process.
- Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next, and changes are harder to accommodate once the project moves forward.

2. When would you prefer Agile over Waterfall, and vice versa?

- Agile is preferred when the project requirements are expected to evolve, customer involvement is critical, or flexibility is needed.
- Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements, where the scope is clear from the start and the product is stable.

3. How does project documentation differ in Agile vs. Waterfall?

- In Agile, documentation is minimal and just enough to support the team, as the focus is on working software and customer collaboration over comprehensive documentation.
- In Waterfall, thorough documentation is required at each phase, as everything is planned and documented upfront before the development begins.

4. How is customer involvement different in Agile and Waterfall?

- In Agile, the customer is continuously involved throughout the process, providing feedback after each sprint or iteration.
- In Waterfall, customer involvement is typically high at the beginning during the requirements phase and minimal until the product is delivered for acceptance testing.

5. What is the role of testing in Agile vs. Waterfall?
- In Agile, testing is integrated throughout the lifecycle. Testing happens concurrently with development (Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration).
- In Waterfall, testing comes after the development phase, so bugs are often discovered later in the cycle, which can be costly to fix.

6. How does risk management differ in Agile and Waterfall methodologies?

- Agile addresses risks early by frequently delivering small, functional parts of the project, allowing teams to identify issues sooner.
- In Waterfall, risks are managed at the start of the project, but risks that emerge during later phases can be harder to mitigate due to the rigid structure.

7. Explain how changes are handled in Agile vs. Waterfall.

- Agile embraces change, even late in the development process. Requirements can be reprioritized in each sprint based on customer feedback or new insights.
- Waterfall is resistant to changes once a phase is completed. Changes require going back to the earlier phases, making it more costly and time-consuming.

8. Can you provide an example where Agile failed and Waterfall succeeded (or vice versa)?

- Agile failure might occur in a project with strict compliance or fixed requirements, like regulatory or safety-critical projects, where changing requirements are not acceptable.
- Waterfall success may be seen in construction or hardware projects, where requirements are clear and must be followed in a linear, step-by-step approach.

9. What are the major challenges in transitioning from Waterfall to Agile?
- Changing the mindset of the team and stakeholders from a rigid, phased approach to a flexible, adaptive one.
- Restructuring roles (e.g., introduction of Product Owner, Scrum Master), adapting to less upfront planning, and continuous customer involvement.

10. How does team collaboration differ in Agile vs. Waterfall?

- Agile promotes cross-functional, self-organizing teams that work together closely throughout the development process, holding daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
- In Waterfall, teams are often more siloed, working within their phase (e.g., developers do development, testers do testing), with limited interaction until their part of the process begins.

11. How does Agile handle scope creep compared to Waterfall?

- In Agile, scope creep is managed through iterative development, and changes can be accommodated into future sprints by re-prioritizing the backlog.
- In Waterfall, scope creep can lead to significant delays as it requires revisiting earlier phases, making it difficult to manage changes without impacting the entire project timeline.

12. What metrics are used to track progress in Agile vs. Waterfall?

- In Agile, metrics like velocity, burndown charts, and sprint goals are used to track progress and forecast completion.
- In Waterfall, Gantt charts, milestones, and phase completion percentages are commonly used to track project progress.

13. How do Agile and Waterfall handle deadlines and budgets?
- In Agile, deadlines are flexible as the scope is continuously refined. Budgets can also be adjusted as priorities shift. However, Agile focuses on delivering value early and continuously.
- In Waterfall, deadlines and budgets are defined at the start and tracked against the project plan. There is less flexibility, and any deviation could result in project overruns.
