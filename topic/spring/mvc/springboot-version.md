   - Dependency Management
     - Version Management: Spring Boot uses a dependency management feature, simplifying the handling of library versions. By defining dependency versions in Spring Boot, you avoid version conflicts and simplify the build configuration.

   - Dependency Upgrades:
        - Upgrading to newer Spring Boot versions usually involves updating dependencies to their compatible versions, which can be facilitated through the Spring Initializr or by manually updating the pom.xml or build.gradle files.
        - Spring Boot's dependency management allows you to use compatible versions of Spring libraries without specifying each version explicitly.
